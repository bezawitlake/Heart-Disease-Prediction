# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection is critical for effective treatment. In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The dataset used for this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which contains 303 instances and 14 attributes.
